This website contains all of the necessary content to carry out the 1 day SAGC scRNA-seq workshop.

The course is divided into 4 main parts:

      1. Introducton to scRNA-seq
      2. Primary data analysis with cellranger
      3. Downstream secondary analysis with Seurat in R
      4. Alternative scRNA-seq data structures and related methods such as Spatial Transcriptomics

There are no strict academic prerequisites for this workshop, however, those with the following experience will benefit most.

-	Basic understanding of Next Generation Sequencing and modern high throughput Omics experiments.
-	Decent working knowledge of R.
